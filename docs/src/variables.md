We provide the following methods to provide a compositional approach for defining common variables used in petroleum flow models. These methods should always be defined over "AbstractPetroleumModel".

```@autodocs
Modules = [GasModels]
Pages   = ["core/variable.jl"]
Order   = [:type, :function]
Private  = true
```
