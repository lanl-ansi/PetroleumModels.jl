Release: 

Dev: 

PetroleumModels.jl is a Julia/JuMP package for Steady-State Petroleum (petroleum products) Network Optimization. It is designed to enable computational evaluation of emerging network formulations and algorithms in a common platform. The code is engineered to decouple problem specifications from the network formulations. This enables the definition of a variety of liquid network formulations and their comparison on common problem specifications.
